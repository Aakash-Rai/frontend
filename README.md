# HackRU Spring 2017 Website

This is an archived branch of the Spring 2017 website. The two directories `/backend` and `/frontend` are clones of [https://github.com/HackRU/Camelot](https://github.com/HackRU/Camelot) and [https://github.com/HackRU/hackru-sp17-website](https://github.com/HackRU/hackru-sp17-website), respectively. Use these as examples and case studies of future website versions, but please do not change anything in this repository unless you are attempting to clean up the files (halfway through development, the `/frontend` repo stopped changing and views were directly edited into `/backend` - it was tedious to change `.html` files into `.ejs` files, which prompted the workflow change. In the future, it is advisable to work on both front- and back-end development within the same repository).
