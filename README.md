# HackRU Fall 2016 Website
This is an archived branch of the Fall 2016 website.

Only the [frontend directory](https://github.com/HackRU/Fall-2016) was preserved. All credits go to PJ Rosa ([@de-Mote](https://github.com/de-Mote)) for building the frontend for F16.

Please update this branch with the backend directory at the time of F16 HackRU, if found. No other changes should be made otherwise.
